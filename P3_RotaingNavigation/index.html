        <h1>Chess: A Game of Strategy and Depth</h1>
        <small>By Gomo Webs</small>
        <p>Chess is a strategy game for two players, played on an 8x8 checkered board. Each player has 16 pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen, and a king. The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means that the king is threatened with capture and has no escape. </p>
